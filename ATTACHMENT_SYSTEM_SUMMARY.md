# File Attachment System Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### üéØ **Core Features**
- ‚úÖ File upload/download for Tasks and Documents
- ‚úÖ AWS S3 integration for cloud storage
- ‚úÖ Secure attachment management with access controls
- ‚úÖ File preview and metadata display
- ‚úÖ Drag & drop upload interface
- ‚úÖ File type validation and size limits

### üîß **Backend Components**

#### **1. Attachment Model** (`server/src/models/Attachment.js`)
- Stores file metadata and references
- Links attachments to tasks or documents
- Tracks upload user and timestamps
- Supports soft deletion for audit trails

#### **2. S3 Service** (`server/src/services/s3Service.js`)
- Upload files to AWS S3
- Generate signed URLs for secure downloads
- Delete files from S3
- List bucket contents

#### **3. Attachment API** (`server/src/routes/attachments.js`)
- `POST /api/attachments/upload` - Upload new attachments
- `GET /api/attachments/:attachedTo/:attachedToId` - Get attachments list
- `GET /api/attachments/download/:attachmentId` - Get download URL
- `DELETE /api/attachments/:attachmentId` - Delete attachment
- `PATCH /api/attachments/:attachmentId` - Update description

#### **4. Access Control**
- Project-based permissions
- User role validation
- Ownership verification
- Secure file access through signed URLs

### üé® **Frontend Components**

#### **1. AttachmentManager** (`client/src/components/UI/AttachmentManager.tsx`)
- Reusable component for file management
- Drag & drop upload interface
- File preview with icons and metadata
- Download and delete functionality
- Description editing
- File type and size validation

#### **2. Task Integration** (`client/src/components/Tasks/EditTaskModal.tsx`)
- Attachments section in task edit modal
- Real-time attachment loading
- Seamless integration with task workflow

#### **3. Document Integration** (`client/src/pages/DocumentEditor.tsx`)
- Collapsible attachments sidebar
- Non-intrusive file management
- Maintains document editing flow

#### **4. API Integration** (`client/src/services/api.ts`)
- Complete attachment API client
- Error handling and retry logic
- TypeScript support

### üìÅ **Supported File Types**
- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Documents**: PDF, Word (.doc, .docx), Excel (.xls, .xlsx), PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx)
- **Text**: Plain text, CSV
- **Media**: Audio (MP3, WAV, OGG), Video (MP4, MPEG, QuickTime)
- **Archives**: ZIP, RAR

### üîí **Security Features**
- Private S3 bucket with signed URLs
- File type validation
- Size limits (50MB default)
- Access control based on project membership
- Secure file deletion
- Audit trail with soft deletion

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

#### **Environment Variables Required**:
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

### üöÄ **Usage Examples**

#### **Upload Attachment to Task**:
```typescript
const result = await attachmentAPI.uploadAttachment(
  file, 
  'task', 
  taskId, 
  'Optional description'
);
```

#### **Get Task Attachments**:
```typescript
const attachments = await attachmentAPI.getAttachments('task', taskId);
```

#### **Download Attachment**:
```typescript
const downloadInfo = await attachmentAPI.getDownloadUrl(attachmentId);
// downloadInfo.downloadUrl contains the signed URL
```

### üìä **Benefits**

1. **Scalability**: Cloud-based storage with AWS S3
2. **Security**: Access-controlled file sharing
3. **User Experience**: Intuitive drag & drop interface
4. **Integration**: Seamless task and document workflow
5. **Flexibility**: Support for various file types
6. **Cost-Effective**: Pay-as-you-use S3 pricing
7. **Reliability**: AWS infrastructure reliability

### üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Set up AWS S3** following the provided guide
2. **Configure environment variables** in server/.env
3. **Test attachment functionality** in tasks and documents
4. **Customize file type restrictions** as needed
5. **Set up S3 lifecycle policies** for cost optimization

### üõ†Ô∏è **Customization Options**

- Adjust file size limits in `AttachmentManager.tsx`
- Modify allowed file types in `attachments.js`
- Customize S3 bucket policies for additional security
- Add file processing pipelines (virus scanning, image optimization)
- Implement file versioning for document attachments

The attachment system is now fully integrated and ready for use! Users can upload, manage, and download files from both tasks and documents with proper access controls and a user-friendly interface.
