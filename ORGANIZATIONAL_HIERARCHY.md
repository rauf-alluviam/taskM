# TaskFlow Organizational Hierarchy Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive organizational hierarchy feature implementation that transforms TaskFlow from an individual task management tool into a full-featured enterprise collaboration platform.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tasks
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Members (with roles)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Members (with organization-wide roles)
```
